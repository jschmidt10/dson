Dvora's Serialized Object Notation

Welcome to DSON! DSON is the next generation of serialization technology. Expect to see DSON popping up all over software 
scene.

_Ok, I already have a serialization framework, why DSON?_
+ DSON requires unnecessary characters!
+ DSON currently does not support nested data types!
+ DSON is awesome!

So now that you are as excited as we are, here's some sample DSON to get you started.

     {dson="true"},
     {name="dson"},
     {type="serialization framework"},
     {age=0},
     {awesomeness="unmeasureable"}
    }

__LATEST DSON News__

Attention DSON army! There are now two DSON invalidators checked in, with the plan for several more in coming weeks - 
including the much anticipated RandomInvalidator which will randomly apply one or more invalidators to your DSON 
string. Most serialization frameworks give you a way to validate their formats, but here at DSON, to provide you 
with the most comprehensive solution suite, we also give you the power to invalidate your valid DSON! Welcome to 
the future!

__DSON FAQ__

===============================

_How was DSON created?_

DSON was created during a conversation between Dvora (hence the name) and a coworker.  It went something like this:
+ Dvora: "I am trying to parse this string but I'm getting errors"
+ Coworker: "Why are you trying to parse this with substrings? Just use a JSON parser"
+ Dvora: "[Another coworker] said I can't"
+ Coworker: "Why not?"
+ Dvora: "I can't remember"

When the JSON parser failed, DSON was born!

===============================

_Who uses DSON?_

DSON is the ideal serialization technology for any application. DSON is used all over industry as well as in many 
personal development projects.  Currently, DSON is being used by the following companies and projects:
